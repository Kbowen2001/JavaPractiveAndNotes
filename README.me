Notes:

Syntax rules:
    -Js is case sensitive 

    Fixed values are called literals in JS
        2 data types, numbers and strings 
            Numbers: dont need quotes
            Strings: go in single or double quotes

    -Variables store data (like labeled boxes)
        var (old way )
        let (modern way)
            example: 
                let x, y, z;
                x = 5; (this assigns a value to the variable)
                y = 6;
                z = z + y;
        
    -Operators
        Arithmetic: these do math (adding, subtracting, ect)
            exapmle: x = (5 + 6) * 10;

    -Assignment: 
         Assigns values to variables
             examples: the equals sign (operator) in the previous example (assigns the variable X the value of the calculation)
